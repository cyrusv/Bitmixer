Jobcoin mixer application

Currently there is just one endpoint to initiate a mix, and no templates or
front ends.

Things to do before this is production ready:
 - Persist our running list of pending mixes (`ACCOUNTS`)
 - Use Celery instead of Threading to poll
 - Error handling in the polling function. We probably want to
 - Unittests and integration tests
 - Virtual Environment, Docker, other Deployment requirements
